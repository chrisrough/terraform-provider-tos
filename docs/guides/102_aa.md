# Authentication and Authorization

A fully operational Tufin TOS user with appropriate permissions is required to manage selected resources.

The provider works using a token based mechanism as follows:

* create the token for the mode in which the provider is intended to be run.
* set this token as environment variable named TUFIN_ACCESS_TOKEN.

The tool to create such a token can be
downloaded [here](https://github.com/chrisrough/terraform-provider-tos/tree/main/tufin_access_token).

After unzipping the downloaded archive the executable file

```shell
./tufin_access_token
```

is available for use in a shell.

## Create a Tufin Access Token for Mode tos

Run

```shell
./tufin_access_token tos -scUser=user -scPasswd=passwd -stUser=user -stPasswd=passwd
```

where user and passwd denote the Tufin TOS SC (Secure Change) and Tufin TOS ST (Secure Track) user, respectively.
The users for SC and ST may be different.

Optionally, an asci file named KEY containing specific key value may be used to encode and decode the Tufin Access Token. 

## Set the Tufin Access Token Environment Variable

The output of the above commands shows the following:

```shell
./tufin_access_token tos -scUser=r -scPasswd='P**8zeV)rrerozqg7ix>3-oC&=rHZ%3H' -stUser=admin -stPasswd='P**8zeV)rrerozqg7ix>3-oC&=rHZ%3H'
generate tufin acess token
v2.1.0
provider mode=tos
scUser=r
scPasswd=..
stUser=admin
stPasswd=..
KEY File used for encoding TUFIN_ACCESS_TOKEN
env var to be set:
export TUFIN_ACCESS_TOKEN=eyJ..3s
```

The last line of this output must be copied and run in the same shell:

```shell
export TUFIN_ACCESS_TOKEN=eyJ..3s
```

The provider is ready to use now.
